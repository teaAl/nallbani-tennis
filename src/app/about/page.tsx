						How Tennis Nallbani was born
					</h3>
					<p className="text-foreground font-poppins font-light">Tennis Nallbani was founded in 2014 by a highly experienced
						tennis coach with a deep-rooted passion for the sport. Co-founder Toni Nallbani comes from a family with a strong
						tennis legacy. <br />
					</p>
					<p className="text-foreground font-poppins font-light">
						His grandfather, Sali Nallbani, was the first Albanian tennis champion, holding 26 international titles
						along with numerous national championships. His family played a crucial role in popularizing tennis in Albania
						from 1930 to 1964, a tradition later continued by his uncle, Fatos Nallbani.
